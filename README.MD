4. Make recommender algorithmic (baby vs large)... blocker is data
3. DATA Million high quality algorithmsa (where do these datasets already exist)


1. User selector (impersonation box)
2. Pages
6. Log-in page



5. Deploy on Cloud Run
7. Host on GCP w/database (firestore document store)

Trello Board
1. Prioritize tasks there (thin matrix game deveoper)


Don't re-invent the wheel
- Look at best algorithms from existing companies and replicate their baby version of that
